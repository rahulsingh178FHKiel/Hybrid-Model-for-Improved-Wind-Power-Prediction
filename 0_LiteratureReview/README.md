**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Performance Improvement of Artificial Neural Network Model in Short-term Forecasting of Wind Farm Power Output

  - **[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9082068)**
  - **Objective**: To enhance the accuracy and stability of short-term wind power forecasting Artificial Neural Networks by using new techniques.
  - **Methods**: The study improves existing ANN models by varying  the number of prior time periods used as input features to refine short-term predictions and incorporating meteorological data  an additional reference wind farm station.
  - **Outcomes**: Both of the optimization  resulted in individual and combined improvements, with the accuracy increasing as the Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) reduced by up to 7.5%  and enhanced stability over longer horizons, reducing error fluctuations in wind power predictions.
  - **Relation to the Project**: This paper directly supports the Hybrid Model for Improved Wind Power Prediction by providing insights into ANN-based forecasting enhancements. The findings can be integrated into the project by using multi-source meteorological data to refine input features and optimizing ANN architectures for better short-term forecasting.
