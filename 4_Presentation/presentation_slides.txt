Introduction
- Problem: Improving wind power prediction accuracy
- Dataset: Wind power output and forecasts from multiple wind farms
- Task: Regression (predicting next-hour wind power)
---

Literature Review
- Overview of related work in wind power forecasting
- Common models: Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Ensemble Methods
- Gaps: Need for hybrid/advanced models for better accuracy
---

Dataset Characteristics
- Data from 7 wind farms: power output + weather forecasts
- No missing values, some outliers/skewness
- Feature engineering: lags, rolling stats, time features
---

Baseline Model
- Baseline: Linear Regression and simple MLP
- Used only previous power output as input
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE
---

Model Definition and Evaluation
- Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM
- Feature engineering: wind forecasts, lags, rolling stats, time features
- Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV (RF, GB), manual (LSTM)
- Evaluation: MAE, RMSE
- [Insert screenshot of model implementation code]

Results
- Table comparing MAE/RMSE for all models
- Ensemble models and LSTM outperform baseline
- Visualizations: bar chart/table of results
---

Challenges and Errors
- Most challenging issue: Merging forecast files, handling time alignment
- Solution: Careful merge logic, robust feature engineering
- LSTM tuning: computationally expensive
---

Discussion
- Improved models significantly reduce error vs. baseline
- LSTM captures temporal dependencies, ensembles handle feature interactions
- Limitations: Data size, computational resources, possible overfitting
- Future work: More advanced deep learning, external data, real-time deployment
